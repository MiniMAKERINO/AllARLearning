What are atoms?
Atoms are tiny particles that fabricate existence. They are the basic units of matter and the foundational structure of elements. 
The term "atom" comes from the Greek word for indivisible, because it was once thought that atoms were the smallest things in the universe and could not be divided. 
However it was soon discovered that atoms are made up of three particles: Protons, Neutrons and Electrons â€” composed of even smaller particles like quarks. 

Where did atoms come from?
Atoms were created after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. And they were supposedly created only a few minutes after the Big Bang! That's Crazy!

Distinct features of an atom (refer to model):
Electrons(turquoise balls) that orbit the nucleus on their rings and a nucleus containing Protons(red balls) and Neutrons(yellow balls). 
Electrons are negatively charged particles, Protons are positively charged particles, and Neutrons have no charge, hence they are neutral. 
FUN FACT: virtually all the mass of the atom resides in the nucleus. Wow!
